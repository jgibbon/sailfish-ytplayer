YTPlayer [UNOFFICIAL KODIMOTE MONKEYPATCH]
=======

YTPlayer is an unofficial YouTube client for SailfishOS.

Find the original Version on https://github.com/tworaz/sailfish-ytplayer

This unofficial fork of the unofficial client changes the following things:
 - adds a quick method to send the Video to Kodimote via PulleyMenu. Kodimote has to be installed.
 - has an updated YouTubeDL library.
 - is basically untested and for my own use ;)
